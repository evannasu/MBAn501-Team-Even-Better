## ClickUp

### Introduction

ClickUp is a work platform for project management that can replace all productivity software in an organization across all departments with one single application for tasks, docs, chat, goals, and team management. It is developed by ClickUp, a Startup founded in 2016, located in San Diego, CA, US.

Here is the official website: [https://www.clickup.com/](https://www.clickup.com/).

Applications for different users:

* MBAn students may find its free version useful to small team management, and can also apply agile methodologies learned in the course *MBAn501 Software Teams and Project Management* to this software.

* Any individual can use its basic features to work on the right things, such as knowing the priorities, managing tasks, and recording the workflow.

* Managers can use it to assign tasks, keep track of what is going on, and evaluate how employees perform.

* Executive teams use it by keeping everything aligned to meet goals faster.

### Main features

#### Structure
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="ClickUp Data Hierarchy"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("img/ClickUp_Structure.png"))
```

Everything is organized in ClickUp by this hierarchy: **Workspace - Space - Folder - List - Task**. Each level towards bottom gives your more flexibility. Plus, there is also an **Everything** to get a birds-eye view of the entire workspace and everything in it.

* Workspace

A workspace represents your entire company, organization, small business, and more.

* Space

Spaces are for high-level categorizations, such as teams and departments. For example, spaces can be named *Marketing Team*, *Software Development Team*, or a unique team name.

* Folder

Folders keep track of lists of tasks. They can represent projects, campaigns, or databases of work items within a team.

* List

Lists are designed to group together related tasks, and show statuses of different tasks in various views, such as Kanban Board, Calendar, Timeline, Mind Map, etc.

Here’s an example of a product management Kanban board in ClickUp:
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Kanban Board View Example"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("img/Kanban.png"))
```

* Task

Tasks are the most basic and flexible units, each with its own description, assignees, comments and more. You can create relationship between tasks, and they can be easily changed through clicks and drags. There can also be sub-tasks under one task.

#### Templates

One amazing feature of ClickUp is that it provides hundreds of templates ready to use in design of spaces, folders, and lists. Whenever you create a new object, suggested templates will directly pop up. To browse a full set of templates divided by user levels and use cases, just click [here](https://clickup.com/templates).

#### Dashboard

Dashboard is a place to build all your work together in a high-level overview. It can be used to develop Sprints, show custom charts and calculations, track progress, and even embed external Apps. You can choose different widgets to visualize whatever you want to show.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Dashboard Example"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("img/Dashboard.png"))
```

#### ClickApps & Intergrations

ClickUp develops a bunch of Apps for internal usage, such as email, docs, Giphy(for using funny gifs), Priority(for setting priority levels), Pulse(to see who's online), Sprints, etc. It also connects over 1000+ external Apps such as slack, Github, Google Drive, Dropbox, Zoom, YouTube, etc. You can view a full list [here](https://clickup.com/integrations).

### Tutorial

#### Onboard

From its [website](https://clickup.com/), click **Get Started** or **Sign Up** button, and enter your email in this banner:
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Sign Up Banner"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("img/ClickUp_Banner.png"))
```

It would direct you into a sign-up page to set up your name and password, and then you are ready to go! Some instructions will pop up to help you create your initial workspace, just follow them by clicking each NEXT button.

Once you complete, you would have a homepage like this:
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="ClickUp Homepage"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("img/ClickUp_Homepage.png"))
```

In this homepage, **LineUp™️** is a place to add your most important task. For managers, it shows a prioritized order of tasks for each person. Now, you'll always know each person's main focus and priority.

**Trending** shows the top tasks that you recently spent time on.

**My Work** lists all the to-do, done, delegated tasks and comments for you.

On the right side, a built-in **Calendar** helps you to organize your day by dragging and dropping task in time order.

In the sidebar, **Notifications** page is a hub for communications, and show changes related to your assignment. You can arrange which platforms trigger notifications in the **Setting**.

## Asana

### Introduction

Asana is another work platform for project management similar to ClickUp. It also features managing projects with one tool. It is developed by Asana, founded in 2008, with a headquarter located in San Francisco, CA, US.

### Main features

#### Homepage
This is my sample homepage of in Asana:
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Asana Homepage"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("img/Asana_Homepage.png"))
```

Many features are similar to ClickUp, but in different design. 

Tasks are shown in **My Priorities** divided into Upcoming, Overdue, and Completed. You can view recent or favorite projects in **Project**, and frequent collaborators in **People**.

Besides the default widgets, Asana also gives you freedom to customize homepage by selecting background and other widgets that you find useful.

In the sidebar, **My Task** is similar to **My Work** in the homepage of ClickUp, **Inbox** is similar to **Notifications**, **Reporting** performs the same as **Dashboard**, and **Portfolios** is like **Everything**. **Goal** is a new function in Asana to see progress of your company goals and keep teams on track. Different projects also show directly on the sidebar.

#### Keyboard Shortcuts

One unique feature of Asana is that it provides a lists of keyboard shortcuts. You can open it by clicking **Help & getting started** in the sidebar and then **Keyboard shortcuts**. Here is a snapshot:
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Keyboard Shortcuts"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("img/Asana_Keyboard.png"))
```

#### Upgrade to find more features
Unlike ClickUp which provides most features in the free version, you may need to upgrade to **Premium** to access many features in Asana, such as Timeline, Reporting, Forms, Task dependencies, Dashboards & custom charts, Google SSO, etc. And another **Business** version to unlock Portfolios and Goals.
