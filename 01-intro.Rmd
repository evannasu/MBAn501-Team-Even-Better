# Introduction {-}

We made this guide for future MBAn students focused on team collaboration and management software that may be used for team projects. The guide will include three parts: an introductory overview of the contents of our guide, a detailed breakdown of the tools that we have selected to cover, and a reflection on how we built this project.

For each of the chosen collaboration tools, we provide the following information: an introduction, the main features, strengths and weaknesses. We have also selected one tool from each of four categories to provide more detailed information on, which will include a detailed tutorial on installation, how to use the main features, how to troubleshoot common problems, and more advanced tutorials.
