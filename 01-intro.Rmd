# Introduction {-}

We made this guide for future MBAn students and other potential users focused on team collaboration and management software that may be used for team projects. The guide will include three parts: an introductory overview of the contents of our guide, a detailed breakdown of the tools that we have selected to cover, and a reflection on how we built this project.

For each of the chosen collaboration tools, we provide the following information: an introduction, the main features, strengths and weaknesses. We have also selected one tool from each of four categories to provide more detailed information on, which will include a detailed tutorial on installation, how to use the main features, how to troubleshoot common problems, and more advanced tutorials.
