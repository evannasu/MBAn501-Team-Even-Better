# Tools for programming

## Github

### Introduction
GitHub is a platform for hosting, storing, and editing code. It facilitates projects organization and team collaboration. The platform is built around "Repositories" used to organize code for projects. 

Here is the official website: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/).

MBAn students will use Github for team projects in <MBAn501 Team and software management> in the summer term. And students can also find many resources about programming on the platform. 

### Main features



### Strengths
- Easy Project Management

- Easy Code Hosting

- Effective Team Management

### Weaknesses

### Tutorial
- Installation

- Start a repository 

- Add new collaborators

- Commit & Push & Pull

- More resources


## Google Colab

### Introduction
Google Colab is a product from Google Research. It allows anybody to write and execute python code through the browser, and to save notebooks on the cloud. So, you can think of Colab as a Jupyter notebook stored in Google Drive. It requires no set up and has an excellent free version. 

Here is the official website: [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)

MBAn students will use Google Colab frequently in <MBAn550 Intro To Data Programming> in the summer term, and are likely to use it in the fall term in order to work on Python projects. And we also recommend anyone who is new to Python programming to use Google Colab due to the strengths mentioned below. 

### Strengths
- Easy to write and execute python code
  + All you need to do is to visit the Google Colab page in your browser and log in your google account. Then you can start to write and execute your python code. 
  + Colab is shipped with several pre-installed data libraries, such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib. It also provides pre-installed machine learning libraries, including TensorFlow, and PyTorch. Thus, Google Colab is especially well-suited for machine learning and data analysis. 

- Files saved on the cloud
  + All of your Google Colab notebooks are saved under your Google Drive account, just like your Google Docs and Google Sheets files. Therefore, you can access to your notebooks from any device with your Google account log-in.
  + You can easily share your files through Google Drive. 

- Collaboration
  + If you are working with multiple developers on a project, it is great to use Google Colab. Just like collaborating on a Google Docs document, you can co-code with multiple developers using a Google Colab notebook. 
  + You can share your completed work with other developers.

### Weaknesses
- Limited Space & Time
  + Google Colab stores files in Google Drive with a free space of 15GB; however, working on bigger datasets requires more space, making it difficult to execute.

- Only for Python coders
