knitr::include_graphics(rep("img/When2Meet1.png"))
```

#### Step 2: Select Dates {-}

Click on the dropdown menu next to “Survey using:” and select either “Specific Dates” or “Days of the Week”. 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("img/When2Meet2.png"))

If you select “Days of the Week”, select the specific day of the week you wish group members to enter their availability for. The selected dates/days will turn green. 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("img/When2Meet3.png"))
```
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("img/When2Meet4.png"))
```

If you select “Specific Dates”, select all of the days you wish group members to enter their availability for. To change months, drag the column where the months are listed to the left of the calendar up or down. The selected dates/days will turn green. 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("img/When2Meet5.png"))
```

#### Step 3: Select Times {-}

Select the start and end time of the period you want group members to enter their availability for using the dropdown menus next to “No earlier/later than”. You may also change the time zone. When finished, click the “Create Event” button in the bottom right corner.  

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("img/When2Meet9.png"))
```

#### Step 4: Send the Link {-}

Under the event name, you can email, Facebook message or copy the link to share the When2Meet with others. Everyone who receives the link will be prompted to enter a name and the option to enter a password. Click “Sign In” when finished. 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("img/When2Meet6.png"))
```

#### Step 5: Enter Your Availability {-}

The left hand side shows your availability and the right hand side shows the group’s availability. On the left, enter your availability by clicking and dragging to toggle between green (available) and red (unavailable) in 15 minute increments. 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("img/When2Meet7.png"))
```

#### Step 6: Check Group’s Availability {-}

As group members enter their availability, the group availability calendar on the left will update. Hover over different times in the calendar to see who is available. As you hover over a time increment on the right, the name of each group member who is available/unavailable will be shown on the left. 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("img/When2Meet8.png"))
```

#### Step 7: Select a Time {-}

Once all members have completed their inputs, select the best time to meet!
