## The importance of team collaboration

Collaboration in a workplace involves a group of people sharing their ideas and skills in order to achieve a common goal.

```

Every team member possesses a unique set of abilities, knowledge, and talents. When everyone works together, they may draw on each other's skills, expertise, and experience to accomplish the common objective. A team may be able to solve an issue that would have taken a single person weeks to solve in a matter of hours because each member may use their special talents and perspectives to advance the cause. 

Collaborative work enables team members to share ideas while also learning how other team members think, act, and function. As a result, the team member is able to capitalize on their skills and learn from teammates.

 <font size=5> Five Elements of Effective Teamwork </font> 

- **Leadership** 

Team leader should be someone that will listen to each team member's different and unique ideas while also keeping the team positive and motivated as a whole.

- **Responsibilities**

When assigning responsibilities, you'll want the 'right person for the job' so be sure to assign roles and responsibilities to each team member based upon their area and level of expertise.

- **Communication**

When working within a team it's important to keep a good line of communication open. When you have good communication then you also have the ability to resolve problems together. Effective communication allows a team to bring together different opinions and points of view for brainstorming in a positive and healthy manner.

- **Conflict Resolution**

Conflict can arise within any team or business so it's important to have a plan of action in the event that a conflict arises among team members. If conflict arises, it's important to deal with it immediately or else it can escalate unnecessarily.

- **Positive Attitude**

Always strive to stay positive and encourage others to do the same. Walk the talk of we can and we will. A positive attitude can overcome many hurdles faced by teams. It can also build trust and enthusiasm within a team.



## The convenience of the team collaboration tool

Analysts predict the value of the collaboration software market to reach **$13.58 billion** by 2024. With newer improvements in technology and an increase in remote workers due to COVID-19, there's a rising need for collaboration software.

<font size=5> The Advantages of Collaboration Tools </font> 

- **Save time and resources**

Emails probably take up more time in your work life than you think. An online collaboration tool could speed things up. That was the case for Google Drive. By adopting document collaboration software, colleagues were able to work on a single document in real-time. Members were relieved of the tedious, manual process of collating feedback and comments from emails. And they saved hundreds of hours. 

- **Increase productivity**

By automating certain tasks and making work processes more straight forward, your time is freed up to spend on more important activities. So, you can get more done in your day. It also means that you can focus on the tasks that digital tools can’t yet do. Rather than collating feedback from colleagues about, for example, a proposal you’re working on as team, you can concentrate on perfecting your contributions and brainstorming the next great idea. 

- **Improve communication**

With an online collaboration tool, your workplace can become more connected than ever. Even when not working in disparate locations, online collaboration tools can help improve your team's communication skills. A good online collaboration tool minimizes the chance of colleagues missing important emails or updates, and ensures that everyone working together on a project is on the same page.

- **Boost team morale**

With a virtual tool that enables better communication and sharing of knowledge, it becomes easier to inspire each other. For example, a comment on a shared document that is visible to everyone may spark an idea in somebody else.
