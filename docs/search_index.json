Every team member possesses a unique set of abilities, knowledge, and talents. When everyone works together, they may draw on each other’s skills, expertise, and experience to accomplish the common objective. A team may be able to solve an issue that would have taken a single person weeks to solve in a matter of hours because each member may use their special talents and perspectives to advance the cause. Collaborative work enables team members to share ideas while also learning how other team members think, act, and function. As a result, the team member is able to capitalize on their skills and learn from teammates. 4.3 The importance of increasing efficiency of teamwork Effective teamwork in the workplace is important for many reasons but one of the most important reasons is to achieve success. When a team works together effectively, you’re guaranteed a positive team spirit, increased productivity, high-quality work achieved and objectives met. Ultimately, effective teamwork results in success. Five Elements of Effective Teamwork Leadership Team leader should be someone that will listen to each team member’s different and unique ideas while also keeping the team positive and motivated as a whole. Responsibilities When assigning responsibilities, you’ll want the ‘right person for the job’ so be sure to assign roles and responsibilities to each team member based upon their area and level of expertise. Communication When working within a team it’s important to keep a good line of communication open. When you have good communication then you also have the ability to resolve problems together. Effective communication allows a team to bring together different opinions and points of view for brainstorming in a positive and healthy manner. Conflict Resolution Conflict can arise within any team or business so it’s important to have a plan of action in the event that a conflict arises among team members. If conflict arises, it’s important to deal with it immediately or else it can escalate unnecessarily. Positive Attitude Always strive to stay positive and encourage others to do the same. Walk the talk of we can and we will. A positive attitude can overcome many hurdles faced by teams. It can also build trust and enthusiasm within a team. 4.4 The convenience of the team collaboration tool Analysts predict the value of the collaboration software market to reach $13.58 billion by 2024. With newer improvements in technology and an increase in remote workers due to COVID-19, there’s a rising need for collaboration software. The Advantages of Collaboration Tools Save time and resources Emails probably take up more time in your work life than you think. An online collaboration tool could speed things up. That was the case for Google Drive. By adopting document collaboration software, colleagues were able to work on a single document in real-time. Members were relieved of the tedious, manual process of collating feedback and comments from emails. And they saved hundreds of hours. Increase productivity By automating certain tasks and making work processes more straight forward, your time is freed up to spend on more important activities. So, you can get more done in your day. It also means that you can focus on the tasks that digital tools can’t yet do. Rather than collating feedback from colleagues about, for example, a proposal you’re working on as team, you can concentrate on perfecting your contributions and brainstorming the next great idea. Improve communication With an online collaboration tool, your workplace can become more connected than ever. Even when not working in disparate locations, online collaboration tools can help improve your team’s communication skills. A good online collaboration tool minimizes the chance of colleagues missing important emails or updates, and ensures that everyone working together on a project is on the same page. Boost team morale With a virtual tool that enables better communication and sharing of knowledge, it becomes easier to inspire each other. For example, a comment on a shared document that is visible to everyone may spark an idea in somebody else.

"],["tools-for-programming.html", "Chapter 6 Tools for programming 6.1 Github 6.2 Google Colab", " Chapter 6 Tools for programming 6.1 Github 6.1.1 Introduction GitHub is a platform for hosting, storing, and editing code. It facilitates projects organization and team collaboration. The platform is built around “Repositories” used to organize code for projects. Here is the official website: https://github.com/. MBAn students will use Github for team projects in in the summer term. And students can also find many resources about programming on the platform. 6.1.2 Main features Hold code in repositories Users use Github to hold and organize projects. All the code and documentation are stored in “Repositories”. There are many tools and features for users to customize their repositories and manage their projects. Tools Details Add collaborators Developers and project managers can work on projects together in Github using the “Add collaborators” tool. Issue Developers and project managers can collect user feedbacks and organize tasks using the “issue” feature. They can also use it to priorize issues. Branch Developers can create a “branch” to work on their changes. Once they’ve finished, they can merge the branch back into the master branch. Version control of Github Version control of Github tracks what and when each developer changes, and allows users to roll back individual changes without affecting other changes down the timeline. Open-source projects resources GitHub is one of the largest communities for the world’s top developers, where you can find almost anything you want. There are many great, famous open source projects shared on it, and you can use and download them for free while abiding by their Licenses. Get help from other developers Developers can ask and answer questions, share codes using the “discussion” feature. As you share your codes, other developers can participate to help you fix bugs, improve project features and quality. Use Github Pages to build your websites GitHub Pages provides a static web hosting service that fetches HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files directly from repositories on GitHub, then builds and publishes the site. 6.1.3 Strengths &amp; Weaknesses Strengths Weaknesses -Easy code hosting and writing -Difficult to use for beginners -Effective project management and team collaboration -Merge conflicts sometimes occur 6.1.4 Tutorial Installation Start a repository Add new collaborators Create a README file Commit &amp; Push &amp; Pull More resources 6.2 Google Colab 6.2.1 Introduction Google Colab is a product from Google Research. It allows anybody to write and execute python code through the browser, and to save notebooks on the cloud. So, you can think of Colab as a Jupyter notebook stored in Google Drive. It requires no set up and has an excellent free version. Here is the official website: https://colab.research.google.com/ MBAn students will use Google Colab frequently in in the summer term, and are likely to use it in the fall term in order to work on Python projects. And we also recommend anyone who is new to Python programming to use Google Colab due to the strengths mentioned below. 6.2.2 Main features Enter and execute code or text with cells A cell is a place where you enter either your code or text to be executed. You can easily add, edit and run cells in a Colab notebook. You can also move a cell by selecting it and clicking Cell Up or Cell Down in the top toolbar. Figure 6.1: Colab cell Files saved on the Google Drive or GitHub All of your Google Colab notebooks are saved under your Google Drive account, just like your Google Docs and Google Sheets files. Therefore, you can access your notebooks from any device with your Google account log-in. You can also save it to your GitHub repository. Both options enable you to share your projects easily with other developers. Figure 6.2: Colab save options Import libraries without installing them Colab is shipped with several pre-installed data libraries, such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib. It also provides pre-installed machine learning libraries, including TensorFlow, and PyTorch. Thus, Google Colab is especially well-suited for machine learning and data analysis. Automatic completions and exploring code Colab provides automatic completions to explore attributes of Python objects. It’s very useful when you are not sure about the functions. As an example, first run the following cell to import the pandas module. Then, as we enter “pd.read”, we can see many automatic completions below, and we can use “Tab” to choose the function we want. Figure 6.3: Colab Tab completion More options for your project management You can also add a “section header cell” to make your projects easier to read. You can use a “Table of contents” to make your projects more contextualized. Furthermore, you can comment on your code by selecting a cell and clicking the comment button in the toolbar above the top-right corner of the cell. Figure 6.4: Colab Table of content 6.2.3 Strengths &amp; Weaknesses Strengths Weaknesses - No setup, easy to write and execute python code - Limited space &amp; time with the free version - Useful team collaboration and project management tool. Just like collaborating on a Google Docs document, you can co-code with multiple developers using a Google Colab notebook. - Only for Python coders "],["tools-for-messaging-and-virtual-meeting.html", "Chapter 7 Tools for messaging and virtual meeting 7.1 Strengths and Weaknesses 7.2 Zoom 7.3 GroupMe 7.4 Microsoft Teams 7.5 Slack 7.6 When2Meet", " Chapter 7 Tools for messaging and virtual meeting 7.1 Strengths and Weaknesses Platform Strengths Weaknesses Zoom -Diverse platform that is constantly being upgraded-Effectively mimics face-to-face meetings -Functionality limited by internet connection GroupMe -Ability to access messages sent before having joined the message group-Ability to message people individually or create public/private groups-Can join all pages associated with your university/organization -Inability to create sub threads-Unable to connect to external platforms Microsoft Teams -Combined messaging and virtual meeting platform-Can see status/availability of teammates-Can be connected to Google suite/Microsoft office Slack -Ability to create and switch between workspaces-Can join all sub threads in a workspace-Can be connected to Google suite When2meet -Easy to use -Usefulness decreases as number of participants increases-Can be accessed by random people 7.2 Zoom 7.2.1 Introduction Zoom is a virtual communication platform that allows you to connect with others through video or audio conferencing. 7.2.2 Main features Chat: Allows participants to privately message one another or send a message to all participants of the meeting. Participants: See all participant names, audio status, and video status. Host can turn off video and audio of the participants. Share Screen: Allows people to share different screen views. Must be enabled by the host. Live Transcript: Provides auto-generated captions throughout the meeting. Must be enabled by the host. Record: The hosts of zoom meetings have the ability to enable recording of the session. The session will notify all participants that recording is on. The recording captures all screens shown throughout the meeting, audio, and live transcript. Zoom is a cloud based platform, therefore, recording can be saved to a cloud or to your computer. Breakout Rooms: The host of the meeting can divide participants into separate sessions. You can run up to 50 sessions within a single zoom meeting. Breakout rooms allow participants to work in smaller groups while allowing the host to move between rooms.
