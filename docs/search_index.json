Group discussion: The group members discuss the group project from time to time, the content and format may vary from group to group. Group presentation: A presentation on a group project or a specific topic. The length and format of the presentation will be based on the rubric provided by the instructor. Agile team strategies: Create flexible strategies within the group. The team can make changes according to the situation and respond flexibly to external changes. Collaboration: In the process of completing a group project, the team needs to collaborate effectively and use collaboration tools flexibly to improve work efficiency. "],["the-importance-of-team-collaboration.html", "2.2 The importance of team collaboration", " 2.2 The importance of team collaboration Collaboration in a workplace involves a group of people sharing their ideas and skills in order to achieve a common goal. Every team member possesses a unique set of abilities, knowledge, and talents. When everyone works together, they may draw on each other’s skills, expertise, and experience to accomplish the common objective. A team may be able to solve an issue that would have taken a single person weeks to solve in a matter of hours because each member may use their special talents and perspectives to advance the cause. Collaborative work enables team members to share ideas while also learning how other team members think, act, and function. As a result, the team member is able to capitalize on their skills and learn from teammates. "],["the-importance-of-increasing-efficiency-of-teamwork.html", "2.3 The importance of increasing efficiency of teamwork", " 2.3 The importance of increasing efficiency of teamwork Effective teamwork in the workplace is important for many reasons but one of the most important reasons is to achieve success. When a team works together effectively, you’re guaranteed a positive team spirit, increased productivity, high-quality work achieved and objectives met. Ultimately, effective teamwork results in success. Five Elements of Effective Teamwork Leadership Team leader should be someone that will listen to each team member’s different and unique ideas while also keeping the team positive and motivated as a whole. Responsibilities When assigning responsibilities, you’ll want the ‘right person for the job’ so be sure to assign roles and responsibilities to each team member based upon their area and level of expertise. Communication When working within a team it’s important to keep a good line of communication open. When you have good communication then you also have the ability to resolve problems together. Effective communication allows a team to bring together different opinions and points of view for brainstorming in a positive and healthy manner. Conflict Resolution Conflict can arise within any team or business so it’s important to have a plan of action in the event that a conflict arises among team members. If conflict arises, it’s important to deal with it immediately or else it can escalate unnecessarily. Positive Attitude Always strive to stay positive and encourage others to do the same. Walk the talk of we can and we will. A positive attitude can overcome many hurdles faced by teams. It can also build trust and enthusiasm within a team.

With newer improvements in technology and an increase in remote workers due to COVID-19, there’s a rising need for collaboration software. The Advantages of Collaboration Tools Save time and resources Emails probably take up more time in your work life than you think. An online collaboration tool could speed things up. That was the case for Google Drive. By adopting document collaboration software, colleagues were able to work on a single document in real-time. Members were relieved of the tedious, manual process of collating feedback and comments from emails. And they saved hundreds of hours. Increase productivity By automating certain tasks and making work processes more straight forward, your time is freed up to spend on more important activities. So, you can get more done in your day. It also means that you can focus on the tasks that digital tools can’t yet do. Rather than collating feedback from colleagues about, for example, a proposal you’re working on as team, you can concentrate on perfecting your contributions and brainstorming the next great idea. Improve communication With an online collaboration tool, your workplace can become more connected than ever. Even when not working in disparate locations, online collaboration tools can help improve your team’s communication skills. A good online collaboration tool minimizes the chance of colleagues missing important emails or updates, and ensures that everyone working together on a project is on the same page. Boost team morale With a virtual tool that enables better communication and sharing of knowledge, it becomes easier to inspire each other. For example, a comment on a shared document that is visible to everyone may spark an idea in somebody else.

"],["github.html", "4.2 Github", " 4.2 Github 4.2.1 Introduction GitHub is a platform for hosting, storing, and editing code. It facilitates projects organization and team collaboration. The platform is built around “Repositories” used to organize code for projects. Here is the official website: https://github.com/. MBAn students will use Github for team projects in MBAn501 Team and software management in the summer term. And students can also find many resources about programming on the platform. 4.2.2 Main features Hold code in repositories Users use Github to hold and organize projects. All the code and documentation are stored in “Repositories”. There are many tools and features for users to customize their repositories and manage their projects. Tools Details Add collaborators Developers and project managers can work on projects together in Github using the “Add collaborators” tool. Issue Developers and project managers can collect user feedbacks and organize tasks using the “issue” feature. They can also use it to priorize issues. Branch Developers can create a “branch” to work on their changes. Once they’ve finished, they can merge the branch back into the master branch. Version control of Github Version control of Github tracks what and when each developer changes, and allows users to roll back individual changes without affecting other changes down the timeline. Open-source projects resources GitHub is one of the largest communities for the world’s top developers, where you can find almost anything you want. There are many great, famous open source projects shared on it, and you can use and download them for free while abiding by their Licenses. Get help from other developers Developers can ask and answer questions, share codes using the “discussion” feature. As you share your codes, other developers can participate to help you fix bugs, improve project features and quality. Use Github Pages to build your websites GitHub Pages provides a static web hosting service that fetches HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files directly from repositories on GitHub, then builds and publishes the site. 4.2.3 Tutorial Step 1: Installation The first step is to install Git. You can install Git-downloads. You can also refer to the Installation options to install Git. Step 2: Start a repository After you sign in your GitHub account, you can see the “Create a new repository” button in the middle of the home page. Click it, then you can fill up your “Repository name”, description, and complete other settings. Although “Add a README file” is optional, we recommend you to create one that describes your project briefly to the GitHub users. Step 3: Add new collaborators After you create your repository, you can view your repository by clicking the right upper corner of the page to enter “Your repositories”, or to enter “ Your profile” and then “Repositories”. Then, you can click “Setting” to manage your repository. We recommend you to add all your team members by going to “Collaborators”. Step 4: Create an R project Then, open your RStudio. Click “File” on the left upper corner of RStudio, then “New Project”. Choose “Version Control”, then choose “Git”. The next step is to copy the URL link of your repository, and choose the directory of your project. Then, everything is done! Now, you can see current files in your repository on the right side of your RStudio. You can also add new files, edit current files in your repository. Step 5: Commit &amp; Push &amp; Pull After you add or edit files, you have to commit and push your changes to repository. Go to the right upper side of your RStudio and enter “Git”. Then, select files and click “Commit”, and you will need to select files again, input commit messages before you confirm your “Commit”. Then, click “push” on the right upper corner to push your changes to the repository. In addition to commit and push, you also need to update changes to your local files by using “Pull”. A kind reminder: you may need to wait for several minutes between pushing and pulling for the first time. 4.2.4 More resources For more tutorials about GIT Push and Pull, please refer to Git Guides For more advanced tutorials about Github, you can refer to GitHub Tutorials, Happy Git If you want to build your own book using GitHub, here is a useful tutorials for you.

It allows anybody to write and execute python code through the browser, and to save notebooks on the cloud. So, you can think of Colab as a Jupyter notebook stored in Google Drive. It requires no set up and has an excellent free version. Here is the official website: https://colab.research.google.com/ MBAn students will use Google Colab frequently in MBAn550 Intro To Data Programming in the summer term, and are likely to use it in the fall term in order to work on Python projects. And we also recommend anyone who is new to Python programming to use Google Colab. 4.3.2 Main features Enter and execute code or text with cells A cell is a place where you enter either your code or text to be executed. You can easily add, edit and run cells in a Colab notebook. You can also move a cell by selecting it and clicking Cell Up or Cell Down in the top toolbar. Files saved on the Google Drive or GitHub All of your Google Colab notebooks are saved under your Google Drive account, just like your Google Docs and Google Sheets files. Therefore, you can access your notebooks from any device with your Google account log-in. You can also save it to your GitHub repository. Both options enable you to share your projects easily with other developers. Import libraries without installing them Colab is shipped with several pre-installed data libraries, such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib. It also provides pre-installed machine learning libraries, including TensorFlow, and PyTorch. Thus, Google Colab is especially well-suited for machine learning and data analysis. Automatic completions and exploring code Colab provides automatic completions to explore attributes of Python objects. It’s very useful when you are not sure about the functions. As an example, first run the following cell to import the pandas module. Then, as we enter “pd.read”, we can see many automatic completions below, and we can use “Tab” to choose the function we want. More options for your project management You can also add a “section header cell” to make your projects easier to read. You can use a “Table of contents” to make your projects more contextualized. Furthermore, you can comment on your code by selecting a cell and clicking the comment button in the toolbar above the top-right corner of the cell. 4.3.3 More resources For more advanced tutorials about Colab, you can refer to Colab Tutorials "],["tools-for-messaging-and-virtual-meeting.html", "Chapter 5 Tools for Messaging and Virtual Meeting", " Chapter 5 Tools for Messaging and Virtual Meeting "],["strengths-and-weaknesses-2.html", "5.1 Strengths and Weaknesses", " 5.1 Strengths and Weaknesses Platform Strengths Weaknesses Zoom -Diverse platform that is constantly being upgraded-Effectively mimics face-to-face meetings -Functionality limited by internet connection-Zoomboming/Poor security-Low quality camera GroupMe -Ability to access messages sent before having joined the message group-Ability to message people individually or create public/private groups-Can join all pages associated with your university/organization -Inability to create sub threads-Unable to connect to external platforms Slack -Ability to create and switch between workspaces-Can join all sub threads in a workspace-Can be connected to Google suite -Can get disorganized with influx of messages-App is quick to update leaving users to adjust quickly-Additive with direct messages and mentioning team members When2meet -Easy to use -Usefulness decreases as number of participants increases-Can be accessed by anyone with the link "],["zoom.html", "5.2 Zoom", " 5.2 Zoom 5.2.1 Introduction Zoom is a virtual communication platform that allows you to connect with others through video or audio conferencing. 5.2.2 Main Features Feature Details Chat Allows participants to privately message one another or send a message to all participants of the meeting.

It is offered by Atlassian, a company founded in 2013 in Australia, its products including Jira, Confluence, Trello and Bitbucket. Here is the official website: https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira. 6.4.2 Main features Jira offers several products and deployment options that are purpose-built for Software, IT, Business, Operations teams, and more. Jira Software is most suitable for software development, Jira Work Management for non-technical team projects and Jira Align for enterprise-level monitor. Here is a detailed comparison: Jira Product Users Use cases Hosting Jira Software - Software developers - QA and testing - Project managers - Agile teams - Project management - Software development - Cloud - Data Center Jira Work Management - Business Users - Marketing - Operations - Non-technical team projects - Workflow approvals - Task Management - Cloud Jira Align - Portfolio managers - Executives - Transformation teams - Enterprise agile transformation - Cloud - Dedicated Cloud This book will focus on Jira Software. A sample homepage is like this: Figure 6.8: Jira Software Homepage Unlike ClickUp and Asana, Your Work, Projects, Dashboards, People, etc. are in the headers. You can easily create a new issue by hitting the Create button, and this would pop up: Figure 6.9: Create Issue Note that in Issue type there is another option called Epic, which means a large body of work that can be broken down into many smaller pieces of work – Stories. This is super helpful when you need to assign tasks according to user stories. In the description part, it also supports Markdown to embed any code blocks. Here is an example of user stories in an epic (Haleniuk 2020). Figure 6.10: Jira Software Epic Example In the sidebar, it only provides two views of Roadmap (which is similar to Timeline) and Board in the default version. But the Code in DEVELOPMENT is unique in Jira Software, since it mainly targets at software development team. It is the place to create an automated DevOps workflow and minimize context switching between Jira Software and Bitbucket, GitHub, GitLab, and other source code management tools. 6.4.3 More resources Jira Software Guide Atlassian’s Guide to Agile Development Jira Align Jira Work Management References "],["epilogue-how-we-built-this-project.html", "Epilogue: How we built this project", " Epilogue: How we built this project "],["group-process.html", "Group process", " Group process How did you use the class material to make your group more effective? Team Charter Team charter serves as a source for the team members to illustrate the focus and direction of the team. We use our team charter to set up individual and team learning goals, clarify roles and responsibilities, and agree on norms and decision-making process. We referred to our charter frequently during the group process. Putting Agile to Practice We deepens our understanding of agile project management through agile practice during sessions, thereby improving the efficiency of our projects. For example, we applied the Agile Rapid Prototyping method to quickly form our product prototype, and built user stories to understand user needs and improve product designs. Collaboration with Purpose Every time before meeting, we would set a specific goal for the meeting. It ensures that everyone has a shared understanding of why they are at the gathering, and it clearly defines how everyone can know when the session is finished. "],["dynamics.html", "Dynamics", " Dynamics How did your group handle challenges and change? Positive Group Dynamics Our group has a positive dynamic in that every team member trusts each other. Especially when we face challenges, every team member is willing to help each other. For instance, when we first got in touch with GitHub and r markdown, our team members were always there to help each other figure out various technical issues. Also, whenever any of us found helpful resources, we would share the resources with the group. For any change to occur, our group always chose to meet first to discuss our further steps. Then we would divide the work equally, ensuring the changes may not increase too much workload on a single person.

It helps us understand our users’ needs. We can outline a user story using a simple sentence: “As a ……, I want …… so that …….” Breaking this sentence down, our team identified our users as MBAn students, UM students, UM faculty and incoming employees involved in team collaboration work. Then, we interviewed two users to understand their intent and purpose of using this product. And we created a list of user stories that represented their needs. From these user stories, we got valuable feedbacks from our users. For example, we were informed that our user wanted to know the strengths and weaknesses of each tool, so she could compare different tools. And she also wanted advanced guides and tutorials of tools we introduced. Understanding her needs, we adjusted our Table of Content by adding sections of “Strengths and weaknesses” and “More resources”. In addition, we made our tutorials easier to understand by adding pictures and tables so that our user could use this book as a teaching material. Project scope changes In an agile project, changes are expected and accepted. It’s important for our group to manage changes in our project. Whenever the project changed, our group held a meeting to address the changes effectively according to our team charter. First, we clarified what the change was, and then we listed the things to do and divided the tasks. Finally, we also set a deadline and expected deliveries by the deadline. "],["learning-curve.html", "Learning curve", " Learning curve Figure 6.11: Our Learning Curve Starting point: know each other We started from knowing each others’ strengths by listing our experience with R and taking a role in the team charter. All of us at least took up one course related to R, so in the first few weeks we didn’t have much trouble with RMarkdown. Learn together and learn from each other In the 4th week, we began to use version control in R. Since no one in our team is familiar with Git and Github, we decided to learn together and help each other. We first set up our project repository together in a group meeting, and ensured everyone could pull &amp; push smoothly. Then, two members fixed the bookdown issues and taught the rest members how to use it. Anyone who needed help can reach out to the experienced members, and figure it out together. When building the book, we share good practices with each other, such as resizing pictures, organizing the repo structure, making a table to be more concise, and adding links with descriptions. In this way, each of us became a better self, which is our team vision.

This will not only enable us to plan our time more effectively, but it will also increase our sense of urgency, inspire us to do our assigned duties, and increase productivity during the meeting. Actively engage in online discussions Due to time as well as location constraints, some tasks as well as simple discussions are done online. We need to improve the efficiency of replying to online messages and the level of participation, which not only allows effective communication, but also is a sign of active engagement and gain psychological safety to each other.
