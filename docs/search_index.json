The guide will include three parts: an introductory overview of the contents of our guide, a detailed breakdown of the tools that we have selected to cover, and a final summary of user feedback and suggestions by current MBAn students. Below, you will find a preliminary breakdown of the structure of our guide, including the different software/platforms that we plan to cover. For each of the chosen collaboration tools, we plan on providing the following information: an introduction, the main features, and who tends to use the tool. We have also selected one tool from each of four categories, as shown in bold, to provide more detailed information on, which will include a detailed tutorial on installation, how to use the main features, how to troubleshoot common problems, and more.

Every team member possesses a unique set of abilities, knowledge, and talents. When everyone works together, they may draw on each others skills, expertise, and experience to accomplish the common objective. A team may be able to solve an issue that would have taken a single person weeks to solve in a matter of hours because each member may use their special talents and perspectives to advance the cause. Collaborative work enables team members to share ideas while also learning how other team members think, act, and function. As a result, the team member is able to capitalize on their skills and learn from teammates. 4.3 The importance of increasing efficiency of teamwork Effective teamwork in the workplace is important for many reasons but one of the most important reasons is to achieve success. When a team works together effectively, youre guaranteed a positive team spirit, increased productivity, high-quality work achieved and objectives met. Ultimately, effective teamwork results in success. 5 Elements of Effective Teamwork Leadership Team leader should be someone that will listen to each team members different and unique ideas while also keeping the team positive and motivated as a whole. Responsibilities When assigning responsibilities, youll want the right person for the job so be sure to assign roles and responsibilities to each team member based upon their area and level of expertise. Communication When working within a team its important to keep a good line of communication open. When you have good communication then you also have the ability to resolve problems together. Effective communication allows a team to bring together different opinions and points of view for brainstorming in a positive and healthy manner. Conflict Resolution Conflict can arise within any team or business so its important to have a plan of action in the event that a conflict arises among team members. If conflict arises, its important to deal with it immediately or else it can escalate unnecessarily. Positive Attitude Always strive to stay positive and encourage others to do the same. Walk the talk of we can and we will. A positive attitude can overcome many hurdles faced by teams. It can also build trust and enthusiasm within a team. 4.4 The convenience of the team collaboration tool Analysts predict the value of the collaboration software market to reach $13.58 billion by 2024. With newer improvements in technology and an increase in remote workers due to COVID-19, theres a rising need for collaboration software. The Advantages of Collaboration Tools Save time and resources Emails probably take up more time in your work life than you think. An online collaboration tool could speed things up. That was the case for Google Drive. By adopting document collaboration software, colleagues were able to work on a single document in real-time. Members were relieved of the tedious, manual process of collating feedback and comments from emails. And they saved hundreds of hours. Increase productivity By automating certain tasks and making work processes more straight forward, your time is freed up to spend on more important activities. So, you can get more done in your day. It also means that you can focus on the tasks that digital tools cant yet do. Rather than collating feedback from colleagues about, for example, a proposal youre working on as team, you can concentrate on perfecting your contributions and brainstorming the next great idea. Improve communication With an online collaboration tool, your workplace can become more connected than ever. Even when not working in disparate locations, online collaboration tools can help improve your teams communication skills. A good online collaboration tool minimizes the chance of colleagues missing important emails or updates, and ensures that everyone working together on a project is on the same page. Boost team morale With a virtual tool that enables better communication and sharing of knowledge, it becomes easier to inspire each other. For example, a comment on a shared document that is visible to everyone may spark an idea in somebody else.

It facilitates projects organization and team collaboration. The platform is built around Repositories used to organize code for projects. Here is the official website: https://github.com/. MBAn students will use Github for team projects in in the summer term. And students can also find many resources about programming on the platform. 6.1.2 Main features 6.1.3 Strengths Easy code hosting and writing Users use Github to hold websites and organize projects. All the code and documentation are stored in Repositories. There are many tools and features for users to customize their repositories and manage their projects. Github also supports Markdown for issues tracking and users comments. And a README file enables users to communicate important information about the projects. Easy Project Management Developers and project managers can work on projects together in Github using the Add collaborators tool in repositories. Developers and project managers can collect user feedbacks and organize tasks using the issue feature. They can also use it to priorize issues. Version control of Github tracks what and when each developer changes, and allows users to roll back individual changes without affecting other changes down the timeline. Effective Team Management Team members can ask and answer questions, share codes using the discussion feature. Developers can create a branch to work on their changes. Once theyve finished, they can merge the branch back into the master branch. 6.1.4 Weaknesses Difficult to use for beginners Merge conflicts sometimes occur 6.1.5 Tutorial Installation Start a repository Add new collaborators Create a README file Commit &amp; Push &amp; Pull More resources 6.2 Google Colab 6.2.1 Introduction Google Colab is a product from Google Research. It allows anybody to write and execute python code through the browser, and to save notebooks on the cloud. So, you can think of Colab as a Jupyter notebook stored in Google Drive. It requires no set up and has an excellent free version. Here is the official website: https://colab.research.google.com/ MBAn students will use Google Colab frequently in in the summer term, and are likely to use it in the fall term in order to work on Python projects. And we also recommend anyone who is new to Python programming to use Google Colab due to the strengths mentioned below. 6.2.2 Strengths Easy to write and execute python code All you need to do is to visit the Google Colab page in your browser and log in your google account. Then you can start to write and execute your python code. Colab is shipped with several pre-installed data libraries, such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib. It also provides pre-installed machine learning libraries, including TensorFlow, and PyTorch. Thus, Google Colab is especially well-suited for machine learning and data analysis. Files saved on the cloud All of your Google Colab notebooks are saved under your Google Drive account, just like your Google Docs and Google Sheets files. Therefore, you can access to your notebooks from any device with your Google account log-in. You can easily share your files through Google Drive. Collaboration If you are working with multiple developers on a project, it is great to use Google Colab. Just like collaborating on a Google Docs document, you can co-code with multiple developers using a Google Colab notebook. You can share your completed work with other developers. 6.2.3 Weaknesses Limited Space &amp; Time Google Colab stores files in Google Drive with a free space of 15GB; however, working on bigger datasets requires more space, making it difficult to execute.
