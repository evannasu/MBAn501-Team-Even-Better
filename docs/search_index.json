"],["introduction.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction We plan on making a guide for future MBAn students focused on team collaboration and management software that may be used for team projects. The guide will include three parts: an introductory overview of the contents of our guide, a detailed breakdown of the tools that we have selected to cover, and a final summary of user feedback and suggestions by current MBAn students. Below, you will find a preliminary breakdown of the structure of our guide, including the different software/platforms that we plan to cover. For each of the chosen collaboration tools, we plan on providing the following information: an introduction, the main features, and who tends to use the tool. We have also selected one tool from each of four categories, as shown in bold, to provide more detailed information on, which will include a detailed tutorial on installation, how to use the main features, how to troubleshoot common problems, and more.

It allows anybody to write and execute python code through the browser, and to save notebooks on the cloud. So, you can think of Colab as a Jupyter notebook stored in Google Drive. It requires no set up and has an excellent free version. Here is the official website: https://colab.research.google.com/ MBAn students will use Google Colab frequently in in the summer term, and are likely to use it in the fall term in order to work on Python projects. And we also recommend anyone who is new to Python programming to use Google Colab due to the strengths mentioned below. 6.2.2 Strengths Easy to write and execute python code: All you need to do is to visit the Google Colab page in your browser and log in your google account. Then you can start to write and execute your python code. Colab is shipped with several pre-installed data libraries, such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib. It also provides pre-installed machine learning libraries, including TensorFlow, and PyTorch. Thus, Google Colab is especially well-suited for machine learning and data analysis. Files saved on the cloud: All of your Google Colab notebooks are saved under your Google Drive account, just like your Google Docs and Google Sheets files. Therefore, you can access to your notebooks from any device with your Google account log-in. And you can easily share your files through Google Drive. Collaboration: If you are working with multiple developers on a project, it is great to use Google Colab. Just like collaborating on a Google Docs document, you can co-code with multiple developers using a Google Colab notebook. Besides, you can share your completed work with other developers. 6.2.3 Weaknesses Limited Space &amp; Time: Google Colab stores files in Google Drive with a free space of 15GB; however, working on bigger datasets requires more space, making it difficult to execute.
